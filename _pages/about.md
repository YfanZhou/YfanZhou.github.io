This is Yingfan Zhou, a first-year PhD student in information science at [School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh](http://sci.pitt.edu/). I am luckily advised by [Dr. Rosta Farzan](http://rosta-farzan.net/). I also work with [Dr. Michael P. Colaresi](https://www.michaelcolaresi.com/) and the Text(Co)Lab. 

Research Interests
======
My research interest lies in the field of human-computer interaction, particularly in social computing. I am interested in studying the relationship between organization, users, information system and technology to design effective information systems and build healthy online communities.

Current Research Project
======
* Cyberbullying in the online community

The goal of this research is to understand how the design elements of the live streaming platforms influence whether and how cyberbullying happens and how users react to it. In this study, our research question focuses on identifying design elements that are related to the user's behavior in cases of cyberbullying on the live streaming platforms. I am conducting an interview study to gain an understanding of the user experiences of online live streaming platforms, especially when the users face cyberbullying and how different design elements on these platforms influence the usersâ€™ experiences in facing or avoiding of cyberbullying.
