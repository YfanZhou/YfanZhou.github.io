Bio
======
This is Yingfan Zhou, a first-year PhD student in information science at [School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh](http://sci.pitt.edu/). I am luckily advised by Dr. [Rosta Farzan](http://rosta-farzan.net/). I also work with Dr. [Michael P. Colaresi](https://www.michaelcolaresi.com/) and the Text(Co)Lab. 

Research Interests
======
My research interest lies in the field of human-computer interaction, particularly in social computing. I am interested in studying the relationship between organization, users, information system and technology to design effective information systems and build healthy online communities.
